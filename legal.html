Effective Date: 30 April 2025 

Squatopia: Full-Body Fitness Roguelike is operated by Clarke Plumo, an individual in Manila, Philippines.
 

These terms ("Terms") govern your use of the Squatopia: Full-Body Fitness Roguelike game ("Game") and your access and use of our website at www.squatopiaxr.com ("Website"), social media and community channels (altogether the "Services").  

By using playing the Game and using the Services, you are also acknowledging that you have read and understood our Privacy Policy which sets out how we collect, process and use your information. 

Please read these Terms carefully before you start to play the Game or use our Services. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use our Services.

GENERAL
By using our Services, you are agreeing to these Terms and representing that you are of the legal age of majority in your country which is normally at least 16 years old. If you are a minor (below the legal age of majority in your country), please have the agreement reviewed and agreed to by your parent or legal guardian.
Squatopia: Full-Body Fitness Roguelike reserves the right to amend or change these Terms at any time without notice.  By using the Services after any changes have been posted, you agree to any new terms.  
We reserve the right to discontinue the Game, Website or Services at any time. We may suspend, restrict or terminate your account and your access to our Services with or without notice if we believe that you have breached these Terms. 

HEADSET APP PROVIDER

We may offer the Game through third party digital providers such as Meta, Pico, Sony PlayStation VR, Steam, Viveport, Apple App Store and Google Play (each an “App Provider”). Where you access the Game through an App Provider, you will need an App Provider account in order to play the Game, and your use of the Game through the App Provider is also subject to the terms of use and policies of the relevant App Provider.

SUBSCRIPTIONS

Subscriptions purchased through an App Provider or third parties
Where you obtain your subscription via an App Provider or through a third party such as your employer (“Corporate Partner”), that third party may be responsible for certain elements of your subscription, such as payment, renewal and cancellation.   
Where you have purchased your subscription via an App Provider, their separate terms and conditions will apply to your purchase.
Where you have obtained your subscription via an App Provider or Corporate Partner, Squatopia: Full-Body Fitness Roguelike may not be able to cancel any subscriptions or free trials on your behalf, nor are we able to issue refunds to you.  Any queries or disputes regarding the same should be raised directly with the App Provider or Corporate Partner. 
Purchasing subscriptions & free trials
You can purchase a subscription through an App Provider.  

We reserve the right to change the prices at any time. Prices of subscriptions may vary depending on the type of subscription and the country where you are located. Where a price subscription change affects you, we will let you know.
From time to time, we may ourselves or through our partners offer free trials to new users. Each person is entitled to no more than one free trial.
Renewals, Cancellations & Refunds 
As the Game is a product comprised of digital content which is immediately made available, by downloading or otherwise acquiring the product, by making a purchase or starting a free trial, you consent to immediate performance of the subscription agreement and acknowledge that you will lose your right of withdrawal from this agreement once the download or applicable transmission of the digital content has begun. 
Where you have purchased your subscription via an App Provider and you require a refund, you should contact the App Provider through which you made a purchase.

If you don’t cancel before the end of the free trial, subscriptions are non-refundable and there is no right to refunds or credits unless required by law.
Your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel. You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancelling your subscription will take effect at the end of the current subscription period and no future payments will be taken. You will not receive a refund for any unused portion of your subscription.
Once you have cancelled, unless otherwise stated, you can continue using the Services until the end of your current subscription period. 
How to cancel

Where you have subscribed through an App Provider, you must cancel directly with them. 
Please ensure that you cancel at least 72 hours before the end of the term to avoid any charges being taken. 
If we suspend or terminate your subscription pursuant to these Terms, you may lose the remainder of any subscription and we will not refund you for the remaining term.
